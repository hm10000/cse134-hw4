3rd Party Script

Answer: I used Google Analytics for tracking for 3rd party Javascript.
I added

<!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->
<script
      async
      src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-KE8DS5WDVP"
    ></script>
<script>
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
function gtag() {
dataLayer.push(arguments);
}
gtag("js", new Date());

      gtag("config", "G-KE8DS5WDVP");
    </script>

in all html files related to my website. So I can track the user by using Google Analytics.
The reason why I chose this is to analyze the visitors. Google Analytics offers data visualization
and where you rank in search engines.
In adition, if I know how many visitors came and what and where they clicked like keyword, I can improve my website and set up the future goal about prospective other clients. I can upgrade user experience and design of my website.
Therefore, from this third party javascript, I can get feedback from visitors.
